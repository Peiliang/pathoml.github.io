We provide four example representations here:

Positive Expression of BOB1

Positive Expression of LCA

Positive Expression of CD20

Differentiated Subtyping Process of Lymphoma

Subtyping Process of Endocervical Carcinoma

## A guide to view these representations

It is recommended to view these files via Protégé. Click on the **File** menu, choose **Open**, find and select the example representations you want to view in Protégé. 

Normally, Protégé would successfully open these files. However, since opening the files involves importing an external ontology (i.e. PathoML.owl) by the owl:imports property, Protégé may fail to find the imported ontology on some occasions (e.g. internet issues). In this case Protégé will generate a dialog illustrating this error looking like this:

To correctly open the example representations, please click **是(N)** and manually point Protégé to a location where the PathoML.owl can be found in your computer.
