To ensure semantic interoperability between HistoML representations constructed by different groups, it is vital to create a controlled and shared vocabulary (i.e. naming system) for consistently annotating the represented information. Therefore, we constructed **Histopathology Ontology**, with the goal of covering all information HistoML could represent.

The source OWL file of Histopathology Ontology could be downloaded here.
